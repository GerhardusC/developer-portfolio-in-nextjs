## Description

This app is my developer portfolio, created as a next.js app.

## About

The app uses three.js through react three fiber to do the 3D animation on the landing page.
Framer motion is animate frames coming in view.

## How to install and run the app

1. Start the frontend:

Navigate to the project directory and run 'npm install'
Then run 'npm run dev'
This will start a development server, where you can use the app.
Navigate to the url given by the terminal.

## How to use the app

Use the links in the navigation bar to get around. The "GCS" will get you back to the landing page.
These are my initials, GCS, for Gerhardus Cornelis Stefanus.

### On the landing page:

Hover over the satellite, and leave your mouse alone. Watch how the satellite starts spinning in the opposite direction.
Hover over the donut, see how it starts pulsating. If you click on it again, it will start moving in a random direction.
Hover over the car, and it will start rotating. If you click on it, it will speed up.

### The other pages

The other pages on the navigation bar gives you links to the about me, contact and projects pages.
