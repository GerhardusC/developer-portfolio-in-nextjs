            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>
              I am Gerhardus Cronj√©, a web developer with a background that
              includes teaching and learning design. My professional journey
              began in the field of education, where I served as a mathematics
              and physics teacher. Later, I transitioned to the realm of
              learning design, where my responsibilities included creating
              educational content for physical science courses.
            </p>
            <p>
              My introduction to programming occurred during my time as a
              teacher. I harnessed the power of Python to create a streamlined
              script that automated the process of generating letters to parents
              based on student performance. This endeavor not only saved me
              valuable time but also ignited a genuine passion for programming.
            </p>
            <p>
              My appreciation for web development blossomed further when I was
              tasked with designing the Physical Science matric course for the
              UCT online high school. Working extensively with HTML while
              developing content on Moodle, I gained a profound understanding of
              web page presentation.
            </p>
            <p>
              I discovered that combining HTML with JavaScript allowed me to
              infuse interactivity into my lessons. I devised a range of
              interactive elements, such as multiple-choice, short answer, and
              numerical questions, enabling me to enhance the learning
              experience in some areas where the constraints of the Moodle
              platform didn't allow for this interactivity.
            </p>
            <p>
              My enthusiasm for web development led me to pursue a comprehensive
              web development bootcamp. I am currently immersed in a 6-month
              full-stack web development program at Hyperion Dev in partnership
              with Stellenbosch University. I take immense pride in now
              officially being recognized as a web developer.
            </p>
