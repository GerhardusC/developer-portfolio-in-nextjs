            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>
              I am Gerhardus Cronj√©, a web developer who used to be teacher and
              learning designer. I started out my career as a mathematics and
              physics teacher, after which I moved into the learning design
              space where I was responsible for writing educational physical
              science content.
            </p>
            <p>
              My journey with programming started very simply while I was a
              teacher. I used Python to write a little script that was able to
              automatically draft letters to parents based on learners' marks.
              This saved me a lot of time, and I started falling in love with
              programming.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some time later, while I designing the Physical Science matric
              course for the UCT online high school, I started falling in love
              with web development. I had to work with HTML every day while
              developing content on Moodle to make sure the web pages display
              properly.
            </p>
            <p>
              I realised that having access to HTML also allows me to add
              additional interactivity to my lessons if I used some JavaScript
              along with the html. From here I designed simple multiple choice,
              short answer and numerical questions that I could reuse within my
              lessons in a context where Moodle would normally not allow it.
            </p>
            <p>
              I enjoyed web development and programming so much that I decided I
              am going to do a web development bootcamp. I am currently in the
              process of completing my 6 month full stack web development
              bootcamp at Hyperion Dev and am proud to say that I am now
              officially a web developer.
