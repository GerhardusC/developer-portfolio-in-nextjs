            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>
              I am Gerhardus Cronj√©, a full stack web developer, trained to
              develop web applications using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js,
              React.js, Node.js) stack.
            </p>
            <p>
              I started my career as a teacher, teaching mathematics and physics
              at an FET level for two years. In this role, I learnt how to work
              in a team to deliver content to learners effectively.
            </p>
            <p>
              My interest in programming started when I was a teacher, and I
              wrote simple scripts to automate the drafting of letters to
              parents.
            </p>
            <p>
              My interest in technology grew, which led me to pursue an
              opportunity to create online learning content as a learning
              designer. In this position, I analysed curriculum documents to
              create learning plans, which I then used to turn curriculum
              content into meaningful learning experiences. In this position, I
              also learnt how to work in high pressure environments and using
              Agile methodologies.
            </p>
            <p>
              While creating content at the online high school, my interest in
              programming grew even more when I found out I could write HTML,
              CSS, and JavaScript in Moodle to make my content more engaging.
            </p>
            <p>
              It was at this time that I decided to complete a part-time,
              six-month, full stack web development bootcamp. During the
              bootcamp I learnt how to build interactive full stack web
              applications and thoroughly enjoy solving problems by building web
              applications.
